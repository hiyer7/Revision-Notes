Confusion Matrix
A table used to describe the performance of a classification model, illustrating true vs. predicted values.

Multi class classification
A classification task involving more than two classes, such as predicting tier categories for stores.

Value counts
A method to count occurrences of each unique value, used in KNN for determining class frequency among neighbors.

PCA
Principal Component Analysis, a technique to reduce dimensionality of data for visualization or analysis.

Non linear data
Data that does not follow a straight line, complicating tasks for linear models like logistic regression.

Feature engineering
The process of using domain knowledge to create features that better capture underlying patterns in data.


Data imbalance
A scenario where some classes in the data set have significantly more samples than others, affecting model performance.

Noise in data
Random variations in the data that do not capture true signal, challenging the accuracy of models like KNN.


KNN
K-nearest neighbors, a non-parametric classification algorithm that predicts a test data's class by majority vote of its neighbors.


Euclidean distance
A distance measure used in KNN to find the nearest neighbors based on the shortest distance between points.


argmax
A function that returns the index of the maximum value in a list, used in KNN for predicting the majority label.

Classification Report
A report showing precision, recall, F1-score, and other metrics for a classification model's performance.

Minkowski Distance
A generalized distance metric that includes both Euclidean (p=2) and Manhattan (p=1) as special cases.

Curse of dimensionality
A phenomenon where Euclidean distance becomes less effective in high-dimensional spaces.


OHE
A method to convert categorical features into a format that can be provided to machine learning algorithms to do a better job in prediction.

Hyperparameter tuning
The process of choosing the set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm.


Validation set
A subset of the data used to fine-tune the model parameters, only accessible during training.

Overfitting
A modeling error which occurs when a function fits the noise in the data instead of the signal.

Underfitting
A modeling error in data predictions due to the model being too simple.


locality sensitivity hashing(LSH)
An algorithmic method of grouping similar data points based on hashing for faster KNN searches.

SKLearn
A machine learning library in Python, popular for data mining and data analysis.
